## 🚨 The Problem We're Solving

In today's rapidly evolving software landscape, developers face two critical challenges:

### 🔐 **Security Vulnerabilities**
- 76% of applications contain at least one security flaw
- Manual code reviews miss critical vulnerabilities
- Security fixes are often reactive, not proactive

### 🌍 **Environmental Impact**
- Software accounts for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions
- Inefficient code wastes computational resources
- Lack of sustainability awareness in development cycles

**The cost?** Billions in security breaches and unnecessary carbon emissions that could power entire cities.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Step 1: Code Submission** 📝
```python
# Developer submits code via UI or API
code_input = """
def process_user_data(user_input):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "'"
    return execute_query(query)
"""
```

### **Step 2: Percy Analyzes** 🔍
- Scans for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Identifies inefficient database queries
- Checks against security policy documents

### **Step 3: Sarah Fixes** 🛠️
```python
# Automatically generated secure & optimized code
def process_user_data(user_input):
    # Parameterized query prevents SQL injection
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = %s"
    # Add input validation and sanitization
    sanitized_input = validate_and_sanitize(user_input)
    return execute_query(query, (sanitized_input,))
```

### **Step 4: Oscar Reports Impact** 📊
- **Security Improvement**: SQL injection vulnerability eliminated
- **Performance Gain**: 15% faster query execution
- **Energy Savings**: 0.23 kg CO2 reduced per 1000 executions
